What is AF:
It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated.
The method that orders the subject.
The factories that build the object
The final objects

What can you do with AF:
Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class.
Use when you have many objects that can be added, of changed dynamically during runtime.
The bad: Things can get complicated.
